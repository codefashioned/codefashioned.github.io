As a child, my dad and I would hack DOS games like <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_the_Shadow>Prophecy of the Shadow</a> (to bypass long conversations with peasants and other boring tasks). Navigating around the operating system from the command line made me feel like I could do anything.</p><p class=paragraph>My venture into programming became serious when I picked up my mother's copy of K&R's <span class=util-italic>The C Programming Language</span>. From there, I taught myself Objective-C and started writing iOS apps. Every app I wrote needed a web counterpart of some kind so, I learned to write that part too. I quickly realized a few things:</p><ul class=ul--unstyled><li><span class=util-bold>1.</span> I love HTML and CSS.</li><li><span class=util-bold>2.</span> I love the freedom, creativity, and passion of the web-programming community.</li><li><span class=util-bold>3.</span> The code behind most websites it atrocious.</li></ul><p class=paragraph>Maybe it's because it's pretty easy to hack together a website or maybe it's because HTML and CSS aren't formal programming languages but, even in today's internet-driven world there's a remarkable void of front-end web development standards, guidelines, and best-practices. "It works" and, "It works well" are not enough. It's not enough that your website looks and feels good. It's not enough that it runs fast. As important as your website's look, feel, and performance is its code, its maintainability, its accessibility, its backwards-compatibility. I am passionate about crafting websites that will last more than my lifetime. I believe code should be simple, eloquent, and efficient. I write code that is scalable, maintainable, and human-readable.</p><p class=paragraph>Before I started coding as a career, I graduated from <a class=link href="http://www.belmont.edu/">Belmont University</a>, worked in a few restaurants and for <a class=link href="https://www.apple.com/retail/greenhills/">Apple Retail</a>, and toured around a bit playing music with <a class=link href="http://theemberdays.com/">The Ember Days</a> and <a class=link href=https://www.facebook.com/hellokellymusic>Hello Kelly</a>. I also spent a few years playing bass with a band called <a class=link href="http://www.trentonmusic.net/">Trenton</a>. We wrote and recorded an album called <a class=link href=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/reasoning-in-doubt/id960082885>Reasoning In Doubt</a>, of which I am particularly proud.</p></div><script src=/scripts/5e26.app.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>// (function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
